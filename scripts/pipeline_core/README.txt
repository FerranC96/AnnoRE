Current state:
-GLANET isn't working again!: 
    JAVA ERRORS when inputing dbSNP and using corresponding flag, but weirdly enough not when using the GUI on Windows or bed/ coordinates format
    Work on it has been put on hold

-Generating unified dataframe:
    Python code to copy and modify vep output to new file
    This file is then read in R, merged with HaploR output (with unnnecessary columns dropped)

-Visualisation:
    Load unified output in R, create plots

-Summary tables:
    Create those from R
