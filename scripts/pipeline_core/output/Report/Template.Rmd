## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

This requires kableExtra!!!!
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
general_stats <- read.delim("../gen_stats.tsv", header = FALSE)
names(general_stats) <- NULL
kable(general_stats, caption = "General Statistics") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  pack_rows("Overlapped features", 5, 7)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
readRDS("../Plots/enrich_bar.rds")
readRDS("../Plots/enrich_dot.rds")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
